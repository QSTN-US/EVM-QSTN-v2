**Introduction**

QSTN provides a decentralized solution for businesses to fund surveys using smart contracts on the EVM blockchains. This guide explains how to set up, deploy, and interact with the QSTN survey smart contracts.

**Prerequisites**

To run, test, or deploy this smart contract, make sure you have everything necessary to run the project. You can find all the necessary instructions for setting up the Hardhat environment [here](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started).

**Installation**

Clone the repository and navigate to the contracts directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QSTN-US/EVM-QSTN-v2
cd EVM-QSTN-v2
yarn
npx hardhat test
```

**Contract Overview**

This repository contains smart contract designed for creating and funding surveys. Key components include:

Quizzler.sol: Smart contract for creating and managing surveys with rewards in Native tokens.
QuizzlerNFT.sol: Smart contract for creating and managing surveys with rewards in NFT tokens.

The Quizzler.sol smart contract allows users to create surveys, fund them, and manage survey data. Key functions include:

```solidity
function createSurvey(
        bytes memory _signature,
        bytes32 _token,
        uint256 _timeToExpire,
        address _owner,
        string memory _surveyId,
        uint256 _participantsLimit,
        uint256 _rewardAmount,
        bytes32 _surveyHash,
        uint256 _amountToGasStation
    ) external payable nonReentrant {}
```

The `createSurvey` function is used to initialize a new object responsible for a specific survey. This function receives key data about the survey and reward configurations. Additionally, as a security measure, the function should receive a signature signed by the backend. At this stage, the contract is also funded with the native currency, which will later be used as a reward.

```solidity
function payRewards(
        bytes memory _signature,
        bytes32 _token,
        uint256 _timeToExpire,
        string[] memory _surveyIds,
        address[] memory _participantsEncoded
    ) external nonReentrant {}
```

The `payRewards` function is used to initiate reward payments to users for completed surveys. This function can only be called by an account that has manager status in the system; at this stage, only the backend can act as such an account.

**Deploying the Contracts**

Follow these steps to deploy the contracts on the EVM blockchain:

% npx hardhat run scripts/quizzler.deploy.js --network _YOUR_NETWORK_
